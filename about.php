            <p >
                Hello, my name is Hosni Berker. I graduated from Cranbrook High School in 2019 and I am currently a freshman at Michigan State University pursuing 
                a degree in computer science engineering. 
            </p>
            <p >
                Outside of class, I enjoy ceramics, competing in sailing
                regattas across the midwest and coding various projects in 
                different programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
