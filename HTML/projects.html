                <p>
                    Every since I started programming I have worked on various projects in my free time. 
                     All of these projects stem from my interests in different computer science topics 
                     like machine learning, web scraping, data manipulation and game development. Many 
                     of my projects required me to first learn the languages' syntax before I could begin coding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complexity of these projects range from simple games to advanced machine learining algorithms.
                     Some projects took weeks to code and required me to spend hours to 
                    overcome problems. Others, only took a couple of days. Usually these quicker projects
                    consisted of me learning a specific language through a project like snake or mine sweepers. 
                </p>

                                scraped the web. It worked by being given a link, then reading
                                all the text on the site and compiling a list of string. It
                                would then sepreate this into new links and text. then it would 
                                read the text to see if any preassigned keywords popped up, record
                                its findings on an excel sheet, and move on to the next site in

                    of them. THe script could then be run again to unfollow them. The idea for
                    this bot was a application for small companys to use in order to reach a larger
                    following and base on social media.

                    I was fascinated by Conway's Game of Life and wanted to try and create my own

                    I wanted to try using the word finding algorithm used in the word finder program in

                    result was much better than the snake AI. After a couple hours of training the AI was able to 
                    compenently beat it's original AI, before training, and play well against a human player.

                    This project seemed like a natural progression after coding a gentic algorithm and snake. 
                    I wanted to merge the two and create snake that would teach itself how to play. In order 
                    to program this I had to create the framework for how the neural network would function. 
                    this proved a huge challenge and took a whole month of work and the best I was able to achieve 
                    was a snake that could avoid walls.

                     one to have an understand of how a language process data and how to visualize that
                     data into snake. This project was not too difficult but was my first expirence in game

                    I wanted to learn about machine learning. As a junior, I wasnt ready for a more complex

                    program was given a word and asked to find it while only being given a fitness score based on 
                    the word it presents. Over time it gets closer and closer to the real word.
