                <p>
                    Every since I started programming I have worked on various projects in my free time. 
                     All of these projects stem from my interests in different computer science topics 
                     like machine learning, web scraping, data manipulation and game development. Many 
                     of my projects required me to first learn the languages' syntax before I could begin coding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complexity of these projects range from simple games to advanced machine learning algorithms.
                     Some projects took weeks to code and required me to spend hours to 
                    overcome problems. Others, only took a couple of days. Usually these quicker projects
                    consisted of me learning a specific language through a project like snake or mine sweepers. 
                </p>

                    To find out more about a project or to even try them yourself just click on 
                     a project name underneath and it will show you the description of the project. To check it 
                    out on GitHub just click on the "GitHub" logo and it will direct you to the project on
                    the site.

                                    This project served to be one of the hardest I have ever attempt mostly 
                                    due to the fact that at the time I had no taken calculus yet and was 
                                    unfamiliar with the math. Out of all the projects I have done this one has 
                                    proven the most research heavy.

                                The program works by casting a ray object through a camera point and a screen point
                                then returning what it hits. This seems easy but once you start adding light, reflectivity, 
                                roughness, and so on it becomes much much harder.

                                both interesting and something that could recreated through code.

                                me to write and change pixels arrays and write them out as new images.

                                go on to play another winner until only two were left. These two would then have their moves for particular
