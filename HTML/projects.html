                <p>
                    Every since I started programming I have worked on various projects in my free time. 
                     All of these projects stem from my interests in different computer science topics 
                     like machine learning, web scraping, data manipulation and game development. Many 
                     of my projects required me to first learn the languages' syntax before I could begin coding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complexity of these projects range from simple games to advanced machine learining algorithms.
                     Some projects took weeks to code and required me to spend hours to 
                    overcome problems. Others, only took a couple of days. Usually these quicker projects
                    consisted of me learning a specific language through a project like snake or mine sweepers. 
                </p>

                    To find out more about a project or to even try them yourself just click on 
                     a project name underneath and it will show you the description of the project. To check it 
                    out on GitHub just click on the "GitHub" logo and it will direct you to the project on
                    the site.

                    Feel free to check out these projects and try them yourself.

                    This challenge consited of writing a bot in python to compete against other bots.
                    The goal of which is to win by placing pieces and defeneding against enemy attacks.
                    My algorithm for this challenge went through many frastic changes as my strategy

                                This webscraper was built in python and, you guessed it,
                                scraped the web. It worked by being given a link, then reading
                                all the text on the site and compiling a list of string. It
                                would then sepreate this into new links and text. then it would 
                                read the text to see if any preassigned keywords popped up, record
                                its findings on an excel sheet, and move on to the next site in 
                                it's list.

                        It was done for a class and required me to learn

                    This is the very first coding project I have ever completed. It wanted to
                    write a program that would go through a list of usernames and follow each 
                    of them. THe script could then be run again to unfollow them. The idea for
                    this bot was a application for small companys to use in order to reach a larger
                    following and base on social media.
