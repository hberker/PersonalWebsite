                <p>
                    Every since I started programming I have worked on various projects in my free time. 
                     All of these projects stem from my interests in different computer science topics 
                     like machine learning, web scraping, data manipulation and game development. Many 
                     of my projects required me to first learn the languages' syntax before I could begin coding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complexity of these projects range from simple games to advanced machine learning algorithms.
                     Some projects took weeks to code and required me to spend hours to 
                    overcome problems. Others, only took a couple of days. Usually these quicker projects
                    consisted of me learning a specific language through a project like snake or mine sweepers. 
                </p>

                    To find out more about a project or to even try them yourself just click on 
                     a project name underneath and it will show you the description of the project. To check it 
                    out on GitHub just click on the "GitHub" logo and it will direct you to the project on
                    the site.

                            be shorted including variables. My goal was for in the end, the

                                    This project served to be one of the hardest I have ever attempt mostly 
                                    due to the fact that at the time I had no taken calculus yet and was 
                                    unfamiliar with the math. Out of all the projects I have done this one has 
                                    proven the most research heavy.

                                The program works by casting a ray object through a camera point and a screen point
                                then returning what it hits. This seems easy but once you start adding light, reflectivity, 
                                roughness, and so on it becomes much much harder.

                                both interesting and something that could recreated through code.

                                me to write and change pixels arrays and write them out as new images.

                                This project makes the long and troublesome run ins with neural networks and trying to convince them to play snake. I was inspired
                                to begin this project after finishing the Tic-Tac-Toe genetic algorithm and deciding that it wasn't enough. I wanted a harder challenge 
                                and I had no clue what was in store for me.

                                Looking back on this project, although in it's way a failure, it taught me many useful practices that I would later use religiously. Number one
                                being, "don't start a project until you understand it". At the time I was fairly new to advanced coding and instead of researching how neural networks 
                                worked I just set out to design my own.

                                My concept was simple enough: each cell would be assigned a random boolean function that it would preform upon receiving inputs, it would then be assigned whether
                                to continue the data to its connections if the value from the function was true or false. The function it could be assigned were along the lines of, "check if wall ahead" 
                                and "food right".

                                I spent over a month on this project and could only ever get the snake it progress to avoid walls. I feel the idea behind my "neural network" was interesting, but did
                                not work in this situation. Possibly, in the future I might experiment with the concept, but if it was a useful tool for machine learning
                                someone else would have probably already declared it.
